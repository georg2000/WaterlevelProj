In this project, selected precipitation data is used to predict the water level in the Rhine at three different locations. A multivariate linear regression approach by including a lag for the precipitaion data demonstrated a significant model. 
## Waterlevel Prediction
Open ```Waterlevel.py``` file and run example code for prediction of waterlevels for last 15 years.
