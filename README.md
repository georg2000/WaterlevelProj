# WaterlevelProject
In this project, selected precipitation data is used to predict the water level in the Rhine at three different locations. A multivariate linear regression approach by including a lag for the precipitaion data demonstrated a significant model. 
## Waterlevel Prediction
Open ```MultiRegModel_WaterLevel_Koblenz.py``` file as an example and run the code for prediction of waterlevels for the last 26 years by using precipitation data of four different measuring stations demonstrating the best results for Koblenz.
